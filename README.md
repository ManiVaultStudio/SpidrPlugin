# Spatial Information in Dimensionality Reduction (Spidr) Plugin

The plugin wraps the Spidr implementation from [here](https://github.com/biovault/Spidr/), which builds on top of the A-tSNE implementation from the [HDILib](https://github.com/biovault/HDILib).

## Build
To clone the plugin repo and all its dependencies:

```git clone --recurse-submodule https://github.com/ManiVaultStudio/SpidrPlugin.git```

Build the project with the same generator as the ManiVault core, see instructions [here](https://github.com/ManiVaultStudio/core).
